   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Tabletoppy's documentation!
======================================

This is a simple library for creating simulations of tabletop and board games.
It contains classes and methods for such things as tossing coins, rolling dice and drawing cards.

Of course, most of this is trivially implemented without recourse to a library. It has largely been conceived as a coding, CI/CD and documentation exercise and may serve some small purpose as a handy wrapper for common randomisation functions.
